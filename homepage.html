							She had stars behind each eyelid,
							And a galaxy in her soul,
							That drew people to her endless heart,
							Like the pull of a black hole,
							She was made of earth and fire,
							Of wishes cast on shooting stars,
							She was a brand new solar system,
							Unlike the ones they'd known so far,
							With constellations ever changing,
							No one could memorise her skies,
							And they thought the thing for them to do,
							Was bring her to their size,
							They shrunk the universe within her,
							Told her her vast expanse was wrong,
							That she should make her life much smaller,
							If she wanted to belong,
							As they collapsed her world around her,
							She felt her inner stars grow cold,
							Until her life was far too heavy,
							For her once strong arms to hold,
							You might wonder how it happened,
							But I guess that it makes sense,
							Because a life becomes much heavier,
							When it's the universe condensed.</p>

							Welcome to society,
							We hope you enjoy your stay,
							And please feel free to be yourself,
							As long as it's in the right way,
							Make sure you love your body,
							Not too much or we'll tear you down,
							We'll bully you for smiling,
							And then wonder why you frown,
							We'll tell you that you're worthless,
							That you shouldn't make a sound,
							And then cry with all the others,
							As you're buried in the ground,
							You can fall in love with anyone,
							As long as it's who we choose,
							And we'll let you have your opinions,
							But please shape them to our views,
							Welcome to society,
							We promise that we won't deceive,
							And one more rule now that you're here,
							There's no way you can leave.
